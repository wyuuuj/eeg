### *Application of the Event Graph*
*[Basic applications] script event prediction, timeline generation, abductive reasoning*

*[Deep applications] search, question-answering, recommendation, text generation*

<br>

## Some other developments in this area
[(Granroth-Wilding and Clark)](https://mark.granroth-wilding.co.uk/files/aaai2016.pdf) propose a new task, *Multiple Choice Narrative Cloze(MCNC)*, which can be used for event prediction

Based on MCNC, [(Weber et al.)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.07611.pdf) manually curated an evaluation set for the MCNC task which is called the *Coherent Multiple Choice Narrative Cloze (CMCNC)* [[code]](https://github.com/stonybrooknlp/event-tensors)
